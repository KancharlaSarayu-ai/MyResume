# Input
The program takes structured data as input, such as my name, contact details, education, skills, . This data is embedded within the source code as JavaScript objects or directly in JSX components in the React application.

# Process
The program uses React to process the input data. The input data is passed into reusable components, such as Resume, which will render the relevant sections like Education,Address Skill. Each component uses JSX to define the layout and CSS to apply styles. The React development server compiles the code and applies transformations to ensure compatibility with web browsers. During runtime, the browser dynamically generates the resume page using the processed input data and style definitions.

# Output
The program outputs a professional resume displayed as a responsive and visually appealing webpage in the browser. The webpage contains sections for personal details, education, skills formatted according to modern web design principles.
